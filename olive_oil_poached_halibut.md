*Feeds 4*

## Ingredients

8 ea **Garlic Cloves, Crushed**
3 ea **Fennel Bulbs, Trimmed and Cut Into 1/4 Inch Slices**
1.5 lbs **Roma Tomatoes, Halved**
1 tsp **Fennel Seeds**
1 tsp **Sugar**
1 ea **Bay Leaf**
3 strips **Orange Zest**
1 qt **Extra-Virgin Olive Oil**
4 ea **Halibut Filets, Skinned**
2.5 tsp **Salt, divided**
.5 tsp **Pepper**

## Directions

1. Simmer garlic, fennel bulbs, tomatoes, fennel seeds, sugar, bay leaf, zest, and 1 teaspoon salt in oil, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender but still intact for 30 to 40 minutes.
2. While vegetables simmer, season the fish with remaining salt and the pepper. Let stand for 10 to 20 minutes.
3. Transfer the cooked vegetables to a bowl and keep warm. 
4. Place the fish in the oil, making sure that it submerges. If necessary to lift level of oil, return vegetables to pot.
5. Cover the pot with parchment paper and cook the fish over medium heat for 5 minutes, then remove from heat. 
6. Let the fish continue to cook from the residual heat while still covered with parchment until just cooked through, about 10 to 15 minutes.
7. Serve with the cooked vegetables.
